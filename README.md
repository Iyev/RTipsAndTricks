# Collection of R Tips and Tricks

**Click on a Markdown file link (*.md) to navigate to a tip/trick.**

* Read CSV file, calculate basic descriptive statistics, fit OLS model (this would be a good place to start for a beginning R user) [`challenge001OLS.md`](https://github.com/benjamin-chan/RTipsAndTricks/blob/master/challenge001OLS.md)
* Optimization using numeric vector indexing for creating a variable from a lookup table [`optimizationVectorIndexing.md`](https://github.com/benjamin-chan/RTipsAndTricks/blob/master/optimizationVectorIndexing.md)
* Mapping Oregon Coordinated Care Organizations [`Mapping Oregon CCOs.md`](https://github.com/benjamin-chan/RTipsAndTricks/blob/master/Mapping Oregon CCOs.md)
* Fit a random intercept model and then a random slope model [`CHIPRASurvey.md`](https://github.com/benjamin-chan/RTipsAndTricks/blob/master/CHIPRASurvey.md)
* Tests different methods for merging two datasets in R. The winner: "Merge" with datatables. [`Fast merges.md`](https://github.com/benjamin-chan/RTipsAndTricks/blob/master/Fast%20merges.md)
* Fast aggregation. [`FastAggregation.md`](https://github.com/benjamin-chan/RTipsAndTricks/blob/master/FastAggregation.md)


**For contributors**

* `make.r` is the R script to run individual R Markdown files and create the output Markdown.
* Since this is a public repository, the example should **not** contain any protected health information (PHI).
* Add a bullet-point to this README.md file for each tip/trick you add.
